# Azure Kubernetes Service

Azure Kubernetes Service is the most powerful and flexible compute service we deploy.

It provides the maximum amount of flexibility, with the ability to deploy specialized compute such as GPUs.

We use Azure Linux Container host for Azure Kubernetes Service which provides significant performance and security benefits.

Furthermore, we take advantage of open source projects such as KEDA (Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling) to enable identical experiences across Azure Kubernetes Service and Azure Container Apps.

Azure Kubernetes Service allows us to take advantage of existing investments across the spectrum of cloud native. In doing so, we avoid lock-in to any particular cloud or platform.
