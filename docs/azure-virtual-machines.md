# Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)

Azure Virtual Machines are a tremendously versatile and easily to consume compute option for our applications.

Virtual Machines are used in a large number of scenarios, including deployment of applications with or without containers, as well as enabling remote compute for developers to consume directly, including such tools as Visual Studio Code's Remote (SSH) extension.

Virtual Machines offer easy access to specialized compute, such as GPUs, as well as complete control over the operating system, including different distributions of Linux from Ubuntu, Flatcar Linux, or CBL-Mariner.

Virtual Machines are often used alongside containerized compute platforms such as Azure Kubernetes Service or Azure Container Apps.

In compute environments that are not exposed to the public internet, Virtual Machines are frequently used to provide secure access to Virtual Networks, via solutions such as Tailscale.
