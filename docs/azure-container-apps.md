# Azure Container Apps

Azure Container Apps provides us the easiest way to get serverless containers running in Azure.

This is an excellent solution for those who do not wish to manage their own Kubernetes cluster, via Azure Kubernetes Service.

We use familiar Azure tooling including the Azure CLI and Bicep to deploy Azure Container Apps.
